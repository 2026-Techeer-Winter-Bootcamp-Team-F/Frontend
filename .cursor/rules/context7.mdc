Always use the Context7 MCP client when the user asks about:
- code
- project structure
- libraries or APIs
- refactoring or feature implementation

Use Context7 by default to:
- read the full repository when relevant
- understand relationships between files
- provide answers with project-wide context

Do not require the user to explicitly request Context7.
